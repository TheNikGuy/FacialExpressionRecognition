# Facial Expression Recognition

Of all creatures, the human face is the most intricate and
varied. One of the most potent, inherent, and common ways
humans express their emotions and intentions is through facial
expressions. Automatic facial expression analysis
has been the subject of several studies due to its practical
significance in sociable robotics, medical treatment,
driver tiredness detection, and many other human-computer
interface systems. Different facial expression recognition
(FER) techniques have been investigated to encode
expression information from facial representations in the
fields of computer vision and machine learning.

The Paper I attempts to examine the domain of FER in practical
settings by discussing and analyzing several research works,
and presenting hypotheses and their restrictions. Further, as
a part of the task, data preparation and pre-processing techniques
are performed on a subset of the Aff-Wild2 in-thewild
dataset as well as the results of these techniques are
summarized.

In Paper II, I propose two machine
learning models, Main and Baseline, for the purpose of
multi-class classification of six basic human expressions.
The results obtained from these models are discussed and
critically analyzed, and alternate approaches are suggested.
Later in the study, we pick the most effective of the two
models and run an ablation study by adjusting three hyperparameters.
